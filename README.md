# Card Guessing Game

This solution is a **card guessing game** where the player is presented with a random hand of cards, and they must guess the correct type of poker hand from a set of possible options. It isn't a full poker game but rather a simplified game focused on identifying poker hand types like "One Pair", "Two Pair", "Three of a Kind", etc.

## Key Features:
- **Card Generation**: The game generates a random hand of 5 cards, simulating a poker hand.
- **Poker Hand Classification**: The game uses custom logic to classify the hand and assigns it a rank (e.g., "Full House", "One Pair").
- **Guessing**: Players are given a set of ranks to choose from, and they need to guess the correct one.
- **Timer**: The game is time-limited, and players have a few seconds to make their guess.
- **Scorekeeping**: Players earn points for correct guesses, and the game tracks their score.
- **Random Word**: As an extra challenge, the game also displays a random word fetched from an external API.

Itâ€™s more about testing knowledge of poker hands rather than playing traditional poker.
